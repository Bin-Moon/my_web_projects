🏛️ ICE Portal - An Integrated University Management System
A comprehensive and role-based web portal designed to streamline communication and academic operations for the students, class representatives (CRs), teachers, and administration of the Institute of Computer Education (ICE).

🎓 About the Project

ICE Portal is an interactive university management system designed to simplify and digitize daily academic activities.
It offers a unified platform where students, class representatives (CRs), teachers, and admins can connect, communicate, and collaborate seamlessly.

The project was initially created for managing activities within my ICE batch, but it’s designed to be scalable for future departmental use.
